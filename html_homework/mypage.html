  	<h1>Salame, John</h1>
  	<p>Hi, I'm John.<br/>I am a Course Assistant for CSCI 2270 Data Structures. I enjoy rock climbing at the rec center. My favorite gaming system is the Nintendo Switch.<br/>I was first exposed to programming when I saw my brother learning Python on codecademy.com and he encouraged me to learn as well. My interest only grew from there. When I took programming classes in high school, I knew Computer Science was for me.<br/>To me, interpreting code is like solving a puzzle; each part you figure out opens up new possibilities. This is what I enjoy most about programming.
